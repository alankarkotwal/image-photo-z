Explanation for the main file:

Assuming that the CAS is already queried and a database ,"one_square_degree.csv", is obtained from the CAS which is in the form
	id,ra,dec,redshift,redshiftError,class,run,camcol,field
The SQL query required can be found in catalog_gen/sql. First get mydb setup using QueryDR10.sql and then get the required fields using (and modifying according to the area requirements) GetArea.sql.
I have already done this here.

General preprocessing the catalog to make the further process a bit convenient needs:
	preprocess_catalog(catalog, output)
Input: "one_square_degree.csv", output: "one_square_degree_processed.csv".

Once this is done, we need to download images from the SDSS bulkFields. For this, we have:
	download_images(catalog, downloadFolder, logfile="logfile")
In the present case, I use the "one_square_degree_processed.csv" generated earlier, downloading images into a folder "images" and creating a "logfile" to keep track of images and remove duplicates.

Next, processing images.
