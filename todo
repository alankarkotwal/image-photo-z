# A list of things to do in the future

1) Check objects that give isolated pixels. In the segmentation maps generated by SExtractor, some segments seem to give pixels that are isolated
   from the object itself. Check why this is happening and see if changing SExtractor input parameters improves this.

2) Some pixels seem to give negative flux values. This also happens in the images themselves, so this is not explicitly a problem with the code.
   Check if this is valid for the training.

3) Check why the image registration part takes a lot of time and remove the bottleneck. The "blowing up" of the sky noise image from the FITS HDU
   takes a lot of time. Check this.

4) Remove duplicate pixels between images. Some images in the data-set overlap and this is necessary.

5) Port the code to run on a GPU.

6) Automate generation of the catalog using sdssCL.

7) Add timing support.

8) Implement other machine learning algorithms.

9) Check the validity of the interpolation used to "blow up" the sky image. Use other interpolations if more valid.

10) Add more stuff to this file.
